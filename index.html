All parents should have enough energy to take care of their children and spend quality time with them without compromising on their own well-being and self-care time.

  Ingredient Integrity

<span class="value-description">
  We understand that parents want to make informed decisions about the products they bring into their home and around their family. Most parents attach great importance to using products that are safe and harmless. Therefore, we are completely open and honest about all the ingredients we use in our drops, how they were produced and where they came from. We care about our customers and provide them with the information they need to feel confident about their choices. At Revive we source our ingredients in an ethical way and make sure to use sustainable manufacturing processes that don’t harm our planet.

    <span class="value-description">
      At Revive, we care about planet Earth. Our planet offers many natural resources, and it is our duty to make sure we conserve them. We care about protecting our planet, not only for the current generations, but also for the future generations. Parents want and need a healthy Earth for their kids to live on. For the manufacturing of Revive products, no natural resources are depleted. From the drops to the packaging, everything is produced with awareness of the environmental impact that we’re making. Our drops are made from local and sustainable ingredients. Our packing peanuts are biodegradable, and our shipping boxes are made of 100% recycled cardboard. Besides that, we donate 10% of our total profits to Conservation International. They've helped to protect over 6 million square kilometers of land and sea. We proudly achieve all this even while adhering to the highest quality standards. Therefore, today’s parents can enjoy Revive without any limitations.
