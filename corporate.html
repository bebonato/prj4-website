          <em>We understand that parents want to make informed decisions about the products you bring into your home and around your family. Most parents attach great importance to using products that are safe and harmless. Therefore, we are completely open and honest about all the ingredients we use in our drops, how they were produced and where they came from.

For the manufacturing of Revive products, no natural resources are depleted. From the drops to the packaging, everything is produced with awareness of the environmental impact that we’re making. Our drops are made from local and sustainable ingredients. Our packing peanuts are biodegradable, and our shipping boxes are made of 100% recycled cardboard.

                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</li>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                  Safety:
                  Our website design contains components that communicate a sense of security and trust to reflect the brand's value of safety. This was accomplished by using a clean and simple design, as well as a concise structure that prioritises the most relevant information. The colour scheme is soothing and calming, with a concentration on neutral tones that imply stability.
                  <p></p>
                  Quality:
                  We created a clean and stylish design, with a focus on high-quality imagery that shows the products offered, to reflect the brand's value of quality. The design integrates features that communicate a sense of elegance and exclusivity while remaining approachable and attractive to a broad spectrum of potential clients.
                  <p></p>
                  Transperency:
                  To represent the brand's value of transparency, our website design prioritises clear and straightforward information. With a focus on simple message and basic language, the design tries to make information easy to find and grasp. The website also features aspects that reflect the brand's dedication to transparency, such as thorough descriptions.
                  <p></p>
                  Sustainability:
                  We combined components that highlight the brand's dedication to environmental responsibility in order to reflect the brand's concept of sustainability. This was accomplished by using eco-friendly design elements such as natural colour palettes.</ul>
                  <p></p>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>
                <p></p>

By the use of colours, imagery, and typography, the website design also emphasises the brand's dedication to safety, quality, transparency, and sustainability.
                  <p></p>
                  The website also makes it simple for customers to understand the benefits of the products and how to use them, which aligns with the overall objectives of the marketing and communication strategy.
                  <p></p>
                  To align with the response objectives of the marketing and communication strategy, the website has clear calls-to-action (CTAs) that encourage visitors to interact with the brand. For example, we are offering a 10% discount code for first-time customers who sign up for the email list which incentivizes visitors to provide their email address, which can be used for email marketing.</ul>
                  <p></p>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                  The design prioritises clarity and simplicity of use, presenting the advantages of the goods and services in a visually appealing way, to emphasise the unique value proposition of Revive's products and services on the website.
                  <p></p>

            <li>Testing methods: Filming participants who are going through the website for the first time. We gave them an assignment to 
              do, such as ‘fill in your email address and submit’. This way we could find out if everything 
              was easy to find.
              <p></p>
              <li>Test participants: The two participants both were our classmates, Marieke Asbreuk and Femke van Erp. They 
                don’t match the target audience, however they both told us they would still be interested in 
                buying our product. 
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Test Setting: testing was done in a quiet room on campus. Speaking from 
                  experience, this was a lot easier than if we had done it online. Both participants used my 
                  laptop, and we filmed them interacting with the website with our phones.
                  </li>
                  <p></p>
                  <li>Testing result: Positive Points</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Both participants liked the design. One of them said the bold 
                  font made everything easy to read.
                  
                <li>Both participants said they thought the flipping effect for the 
                  three products: Revive Energise, Revive Relax, and Revive 
                  Sleep, and that you could see more information about the 
                  products when moving over the pictures with the cursor.
                  
                <li>Both participants liked that the values made a little movement 
                  when moving over them with the cursor. They also liked the 
                  way they were portrayed.
                <p></p>                  
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Testing result: Negative Points
              <ul>
                <li> The video on the home page doesn’t play automatically; the participants would’ve 
                  liked it more if it did.
                  <li>One of our participants would’ve liked a drop down menu for the home page.</li>
                  <li>One of our participants would’ve liked if we wrote a little text per team member, so it’s 
                    more personal.</li>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>Improvements: Further improve the copy, for the products description and the team members. Fix minor bugs, such as the flipping effect, which is not totally functional.</li>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our brand is committed to providing consumers, especially parents of young children, with an organic, sugar-free, and healthy option for boosting their energy levels a couple drops at a time. The drops are versatile and can be added to a variety of foods and beverages, making it easy for consumers to incorporate them into their daily routines. We prioritize transparency in all aspects of our production process, from ingredient sourcing to manufacturing and packaging. By choosing our brand, consumers can feel confident that they are making a positive impact on their health, the environment, and their community.</p>
          <p>We have chosen to use Instagram as a social media platform for exposure for our brand "Revive" as it has one of the highest percentages of parents with young children on it and will also help us reach our marketing objectives.
            According to a Pew Research Centre poll performed in 2021, parents with children under the age of 18 utilise a range of social media sites to keep connected and active with their family and friends, and 41% of parents use Instagram to post images and interact with other parents (Auxier et al., 2022).</p>
            <p>Instagram can be a helpful marketing tool to promote our brand in several ways:</p>
            <ul class="points"></ul>
          <li>Visual storytelling: Instagram is a visual platform that allows businesses to tell their brand story through images and videos. This provides a unique opportunity for us to showcase our  products in a creative and visually appealingly way. </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Brand awareness and social proof: With over 1 billion monthly active users, Instagram offers a vast platform for businesses to reach a wide audience. Companies may use hashtags and promote their postings to enhance brand recognition and attract new consumers.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Targeted advertising: Using Instagram's advertising platform, we may tailor our ads to certain demographics, hobbies, and behaviors. This implies that we may reach out to people who are more likely to be interested in our products or services, enhancing the efficacy of our advertising campaigns.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Influencer marketing: Instagram is well-known for its influencer marketing, collaborating with well-known users to promote a business or product. This may be a very successful strategy to reach out to new people and raise brand recognition. </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Engaging with customers: It allows us to interact with our consumers via comments, direct messaging, and user-generated content. We would be able to establish a devoted following and improve brand loyalty by reacting to comments and sharing user-generated material.</li>
            <p></p>
            <p>Ways this connects to our objectives:</p>
            <li>Different types of posts:
              To reach our objectives we decided to use a combination of product posts, tips and trick posts, quote posts, recipe posts and reels to gain a broader knowledge on what people are the most interested seeing on our page and attract as many people interested in different types of posts within our target group as possible.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Hashtags:
              We used different sets of hashtags to track reach performance on different posts and attract people interested in the topics of health, fitness, healthy recipes and supplements.
            </li>
            <p></p>
              <li>Reels:
                To be able to reach as many people as possible we also took advantage or reels. For starters, because Reels are visible not only to your followers, they can help you reach a larger audience. Reels also allow you to express your creativity through the use of music, filters, and effects. Using trending audios and participating in “trends” helps the videos’s engagement and exposure.
            </li>
            <p></p>
                <li>Interactive stories:
                  Interactive stories were a great way for us to increase engagement on Instagram, because they encouraged our viewers to interact with our content. Our interactive stories typically involved polls, questions, and swipe emojis that encouraged our viewers to engage with the content by answering questions or providing feedback.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                  <p>Objectives:</p>
                  <li>Reach objective: Our primary goal is to reach as many parents with young children as possible. 
                    We aim to achieve this by leveraging the social media platform Instagram, to increase the visibility of our Website. Our target is to reach at least 1000 people on Instagram, collectively through all the posts, by the 9th of April, 2023. </li>
                    <p>Reflection: We reached 1236 people of which 1141 were non followers, so the reach objective was met.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Affect objectives: 
                      - We want our target audience to feel energized, hopeful, and confident about being a new parent. 
                      We aim to achieve this by highlighting the benefits of the products our brand would eventually sell, which would help them energize and get ready to tackle another day, and the valuable information people would be able to gain from our Instagram account. We would achieve that by writing informational captions (copywriting) under our Instagram posts. 
                      </li>
                      <p></p>
                    <li>Response objectives: Our goal is to encourage our target audience to interact with our posts on social media (like & comment) and go to our website to then further give us their email for email marketing. 
                      We aim to achieve this by creating a pop up with discounts when people give their email for email marketing
                      </li>
                    
                      

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>(check appendix for marketing analytics)</p>
          <li>Reels performance:
            We expected for the reels to reach significantly more people than the posts. Only one of the reels performed significantly better than the usual posts. 
            What we found was that this specific real, which performed better than the rest had no text on screen at any point of the video. 
            Not telling people the end goal of a video is crucial for the watch time. All the other reels had an explanation of the end goal in the first 3 seconds of the clip, so people already had an idea of what they were watching (Halloumi salad, Green smoothie, Smoothie bowl, etc). 
            Lastly the text on those videos was added with an external software, and not by using the Instagram fonts available for reels, which we later found out was detrimental for the algorithm.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Post performance: We expected for the Recipe posts to be the ones with the highest amount of engagement, due to the informative content. That was the case consistently. However, there were a couple of product posts with nice visuals and the “tips and tricks” post which did outperform/matched the performance of the recipe posts. We also found that adding a sound/music on a static posts makes it perform a little better than usual, because the music in combination with the visuals, catches the users attention better than just visuals. On the contradictory whenever the posts were just simply “quotes” the performance was lower than the usual.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Stories: Just like expected, the interactive posts had the highest amounts of engagement with the public. With the most engaging one of the ones we tried being the poll story. This, we learned, is due to the fact that the only way of interaction with a normal static story is by either replying or liking it, while with an “interactive story’ you have a third way of interaction which usually really makes the viewer enticed to react.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Boosted post: 
              During the duration of our campaign we boosted one of our better performing posts for a little under 10 euros, to experiment and see how much more engagement and reach a boosted post can give us, compared to the organic ones.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <p>Results and what we learned:</p>
              <p>We got 30 profile visits from the ad alone. Taking into consideretion that the objective for the campaign was “more profile visits” and reach, and not engagement (likes and comments), we do consider the “boosted post” as a success. 
                The reach grew by almost 10 times (from the usual 78-80 people to 762 people), even though the engagement only grew with one like during the duration of the boosted post.
              </p>
              <p></p>

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we were to continue with running this account, we would focus on incorporating actual people into our social media platform’s post, as well as showing video commercials that include real people using a product and expressing their personal experience. These advertisements would not only highlight the product, but also the eventual objective of using it. 
            <p></p>
            We want potential buyers to imagine themselves using a product and getting comparable results when they witness others enjoying its benefits, because people buy products that other people buy, for multiple different reasons such as: fear of missing out (FOMO), social proof- they may believe that if so many other people are buying it, then it must be a good product, and convenience- sometimes, people may simply not have the time or desire to research products on their own, so they trust other people’s opinions.
            We want to generate a sense of trust and sincerity that other types of advertising cannot reach, as well as brand loyalty. 
            <p></p>
            Also, after getting feedback on our social media from the public, a lot of people commented on the fact that they would like to see more real people talking about their experience with the product, and see more of the energetic side of the product on posts, not just the healthy benefits.
            <p></p>
            
            We would also create an affiliate program for small influencers to generate an affiliate code for their followers, to create free ambassadors. For Revive, an affiliate program for small influencers can be highly advantageous. By creating an affiliate program, we can reach a wider audience of potential customers who may not have heard of our brand before. Small influencers can promote Revive's products to their followers, who are more likely to trust and engage with them, leading to increased brand awareness and potential sales. Furthermore, an affiliate program can help us establish relationships with influencers, which can lead to further collaborations and partnerships in the future. It can also be a cost-effective way for us to advertise and market our products, as we only pay commissions on successful sales, making it a low-risk investment with potentially high returns.

          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Single parents: single parents love to use Revive, because besides being a parent and taking care of themselves, they have the extra challenge of not having a partner to fall back on when needed.

          <ul>
            <li>All Revive products are sugar- and caffeine-free, in contrast to most coffee, sports drinks, and energy drinks. </li>
            <li>Despite using stricly healthy ingredients and sustainable manufacturing processes, Revive stays cheap. This is because everything in the production process happens in the Netherlands. All ingredients are from the country Revive was found, resulting in low transport costs. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Influencer partnerships: Popular influencers who have children of their own, will receive Revive products to test and review. Other parents who follow them and are inspired by what they do, will get influenced by positive reviews and will want to get Revive products, too. </li>
            <li>Email marketing: Customers who want to be the first to know about for example special offers and new products, can sign up for an email newsletter. Every once in a while, they will receive special discount codes, for example on their birthdays. The codes will make them want to place an order on our website. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customer retention rate: we care about keeping our customers satisfied, which results in a high percentage of them coming back over and over again to buy our products. Our retention rate is currently at 40%, but we always strive for a higher rate. We are consistent with posting on social media and sending out email newsletters, so customers keep on getting reminded about Revive products. Through these reminders we motivate customers to buy our products again</li>
            <li>Monthly visitors to our website: we strive to have as many visitors to our website as possible. We strive to have at least 15.000 visitors per month. Besides the number of visitors, we also consider the percentage of visitors that actually buy a Revive product. To keep this percentage as high as possible, we regularly offer discounts, and make sure that our products are high-quality, so customers will buy them over and over again. </li>
          </ul>

            <li>Sales revenue from recipe books. Revive will develop several books, for example a smoothie book, a vegan cookbook, a vegetarian cookbook and so forth.

These aren’t always the cheapest, but it is important to us to stick to our values. Besides the production process, we also only use natural and local ingredients. We get our ingredients from farmers who care about the planet and produce sustainably. The production of one bottle of Revive costs €15, and we sell bottles for €30 each. This way we make a profit of €15 per bottle. The production costs are variable costs and vary proportionally with the volume of produced bottles. If we sell 10.000 bottles in a year, that means we have a profit of €150.000. </li>
            <li>Website maintenance fees: to keep our website up to date, a web developer has to be hired. It is important to update the website and add new and exciting content regularly, to keep website visitors interested in buying our products. The website maintenance fee is a fixed cost.

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Revive is a brand that provides young parents with healthy, sustainable, and safe-to-use 
            products to help them relax, sleep, and re-energize. Revive Sleep can be used for an infinite 
            amount of time, unlike sleep medication. Revive Relax provides consumers with a more 
            effective dose of natural, safe calming ingredients, in contrast to for example most types of 
            tea, which often contain caffeine. (Revive Energize: This is a product that helps parents to re-energize after a long day filled 
            with responsibilities, so they can have a bit more time in their days to spend on themselves.)
            <p></p>
            Unlike sugary energy drinks, from for example Monster Energy or Red Bull, or caffeine-laden 
            beverages, like a Starbucks iced latte, our drops provide a natural source of energy that 
            won't leave you feeling jittery or anxious. Plus, they're easy to take with you on the go – just 
            toss them in your purse or gym bag and add them to your water whenever you need a quick 
            pick-me-up.
            <p></p>
            Our energizing drops are also a great alternative to traditional sports drinks, which are often 
            loaded with sugar and artificial ingredients. Whether you're hitting the gym or going for a run, 
            our drops will help keep you hydrated and energized without any of the unwanted side 
            effects. Additionally, the energizing water drops are free from artificial sweeteners and 
            flavors, making them a healthier alternative to sugary drinks that can lead to crashes and energy slumps.</p>
